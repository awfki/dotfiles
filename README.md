.files for Mac

Need a linux version too. 

And maybe one that does custom things depending on which box I'm on.

2014-07-08: I really need to sort out the difference between .bashrc and .bash_profile and where things belong.

# I think...
# bash_profile is called for interactive/login shells, ie. it's for use by humans
# bashrc is... also mostly used by humans. I don't get it.

# I want a way to set variable TODAY to YYYY-MM-DD and update it at 0001 but there
# doesn't seem to be one.
# TODAY=`date +%Y-%m-%d`; export TODAY
